Mapbox.Vectors
==============

Decoder for the mapbox vector format using protobuf-net and C#. For the specification check:

https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec

A first stab at decoding mapbox vector tiles in C#. Contains for now only the .proto generated code and a simple unittest decoding a test-tile.
